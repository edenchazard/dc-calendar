## Setup

You'll need `docker` and `docker compose`.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Production

The calendar is designed to be compatible with SSG, that means it can be generated and deployed to a static host.

```bash
npm run generate
```

Follow the instructions to deploy the build to your static host.
